We welcome contributions and we are always thinking about new ways to improve the generator and our source code. Here are the guidelines we'd like you to follow:

 - [Question or Problem?](#question)
 - [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
 - [Feature Requests](#feature)
 - [Submission Guidelines](#submit)
 - [Coding Rules](#rules)
 - [Commit Guidelines](#commit)

### Got a Question or Problem?
If you have questions about how to use Bannertime, please direct these to [Gitter][gitter].

### Found an Issue?
If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

**Please see the Submission Guidelines below**.

### Want a Feature?
You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][github]. If you would like to
implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:

* **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first on our [Gitter][gitter]
so that we can better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that
it is successfully accepted into the project.
* **Small Changes** can be crafted and submitted to the [GitHub Repository][github] as a Pull Request.

### Want a Doc Fix?
If you want to help improve the docs, it's a good idea to let others know what you're working on to
minimize duplication of effort. Before starting, check out the issue queue for [Milestone:Documentation][docs-milestone].
Comment on an issue to let others know what you're working on, or create a new issue if your work
doesn't fit within the scope of any of the existing doc fix projects.

### Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an Issue
Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  Providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps.
* **Generator Version** - is it a regression?
* **Sample code** Should be included in [code blocks][github-markdown]
* **.yo-rc.json** - A copy of your `.yo-rc.json` is highly appreciated.
* **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you.
* **Browsers and Operating System** - is this a problem with all browsers or only IE8?
* **Reproduce the Error** - provide a live example (using [Codepen][codepen] or
  [JSFiddle][jsfiddle]) or a unambiguous set of steps.
* **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

### Submitting a Pull Request
Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/pyramidium/generator-bannertime/pulls) for an open or closed Pull Request
  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
* Fork the repo and clone it.
* Make your changes in a new git branch:

```bash
$ git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
```

* Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.
* Follow our [Coding Rules](#rules).
* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our
  [commit message conventions](#commit-message-format). Adherence to the [commit message conventions](#commit-message-format)
  is required.

```bash
$ git commit -a
```
Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

* Push your branch to GitHub:

```bash
$ git push origin my-fix-branch
```

* In GitHub, send a pull request to `generator-bannertime:master`.
* If we suggest changes then:
  * Make the required updates.
  * Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

```bash
$ git rebase master -i
$ git push origin my-fix-branch -f
```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository:

* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

```bash
$ git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
```

* Check out the master branch:

```bash
$ git checkout master -f
```

* Delete the local branch:

```bash
$ git branch -D my-fix-branch
```

* Update your master with the latest upstream version:

```bash
$ git pull --ff upstream master
```

### Coding Rules
To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* Please brief yourself on the [Airbnb][airbnb] style guide with two space indent.

### Git Commit Guidelines

### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation

### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
